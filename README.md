QuickTrip : Seamless Intercity transportation system

QuickTrip is an intercity transportation management system designed to tackle common
challenges in ticket purchasing, including long queues, price fraud, and trip safety concerns.
Acting as an intermediary between travelers and private car operators, QuickTrip provides a
mobile application for users to purchase tickets digitally and an admin dashboard for efficient
system management.
The system addresses the frustration of physical queuing by enabling customers to book
tickets remotely, reducing congestion at transport stations. It also promotes transparency by
standardizing ticket prices, minimizing opportunities for fare manipulation by drivers. Users
can easily search destinations, buy tickets, receive payment confirmations via SMS, and view
booking history through the mobile app, while drivers receive real-time alerts for fully
booked cars to maintain order and timely departures. Admins and sub-admins play a crucial
role in managing transactions, confirming travelers, addressing alerts, and ensuring safe and
transparent trips.
QuickTrip brings convenience, efficiency, and reliability to intercity transportation, fostering
a safer, fairer, and more organized travel experience for passengers and operators alike.
